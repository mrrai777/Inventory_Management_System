# Inventory_Management_System
This is Inventory Management System project, which I have created using PYTHON. 
This can manage the inventory of a shop like how many product they have in stock, and also the quantity of each product.
Even if user is purchasing something that is also possible and it can generate the bill for user. I have used  a JSON file to manage it.
